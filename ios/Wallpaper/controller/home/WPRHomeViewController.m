 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 2, June 1991
 
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 
 Preamble
 
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 
 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.
 
 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the software.
 
 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors' reputations.
 
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 
 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 
 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 along with the Program.
 
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 
 a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
 b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
 part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
 parties under the terms of this License.
 
 c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
 when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
 interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
 announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
 notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
 a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
 these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
 License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
 does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
 the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Program.
 
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 
 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 
 a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
 source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 
 b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
 years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
 cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
 customarily used for software interchange; or,
 
 c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
 to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
 allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
 received the program in object code or executable form with such
 an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 
 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
 itself accompanies the executable.
 
 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 
 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 parties remain in full compliance.
 
 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.
 
 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.
 
 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.
 
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 
 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 Foundation.
 
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 
 NO WARRANTY
 
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 
 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 
 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 
 <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 
 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
 (at your option) any later version.
 
 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.
 
 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
 with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
 
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 
 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
 when it starts in an interactive mode:
 
 Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
 Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
 under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
 be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 
 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
 `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
 
 <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
 Ty Coon, President of Vice
 
 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
 Public License instead of this License.
